  ## Description<a name="description"></a>
  This project demonstartes the api routes for a database that uses MongoDB to store all of the data. While this is not a functioning web application, it demonstrates how the data can be pulled, added, updated orr delted from the database. 

  ## Installation<a name="installation"></a>
  You will need mongoDB and insomnia in order to run the api requests yourself. 

  ## Usage<a name="usage"></a> 
  To use this yourself, clone the repo and run npm run seed to seed the database. Then run npm run dev to open the local server and test all of the api routes. View this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kVegxXUuWvxUN_vmwzz7hLfGGw--PTXT/view) for a demonstration.
